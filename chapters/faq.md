# FAQ: General

In this section TA's and students can add FAQ's from the piazza. As
the material especially the programming related one is so useful that
it is shared by now in multiple classes, however they use different
piazza's sharing the information in an FAQ in the handbook allows us
to quickly disseminate the relevant information between classes. If an
FAQ is only for one class we will be especially mark it.

## Where to find the FAQ as markdown?

General FAQs are in

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/faq.md>

For 516 we have also

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/faq-516.md>

For 523 we have

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/faq-523.md>


## Why are some FAQs that are on piazza not here?

Two reason:

1. some of them need not to be in this FAQ.

2. The TAs will evaluate the FAQs every day at the end of the day and
   integrate those that need to be in this list at that time. Hence it
   may take up to 24 hours for FAQs to apear here.

Once an FAQ is in the book answered (it may actually be part of
another section, TAs will mark the FAQ in piazza, so you can make sure
which FAQs are already in the book. We recommend to look in the book
as there could be information in it that you otherwise missed.

## Can I assume that all information is in the FAQ to do the class?

No. The class book will be our main source of information not just a
single file.

## How do I find all FAQs on Piazza?

Two ways exist

a) Please visit your class piazza. You will find a "faq" tag in your
piazza window. Click on it and all posts marked with FAQ will show up,

b) In the search field type in FAQ. All posts with the text FAQ in it
will be listed.
