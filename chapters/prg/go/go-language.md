# Go Language :o: {#s-go-language}

:warning: This section is under development. It is contributed by Qianqian

Go is a computer language developed by Google with the goal 
to "build simple, 
reliable, and efficient software". 
The language is open source and the main Web page is

## Program Structure 

  A Go program basically consists of the following parts −

* Package Declaration
* Import Packages
* Functions
* Variables
* Statements and Expressions
* Comments

### A simple example
Firstly, look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello Tomorrow" 

```go 
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
   /* This is a very easy program. */
	fmt.Println("Hello Tomorrow!")
    }
```
Let us explain in detail about the meaning of different parts of the above program.

* The first line of the program package main defines the package name in which this program should lie. It is a mandatory statement, as Go programs run in packages. The main package is the starting point to run the program. Each package has a path and name associated with it.
* The next line import "fmt" is a preprocessor command which tells the Go compiler to include the files lying in the package fmt.
* The next line func main() is the main function where the program execution begins.
* The next line /*...*/ is ignored by the compiler and it is there to add comments in the program. Comments are also represented using // similar to Java or C++ comments.
* The next line fmt.Println(...) is another function available in Go which causes the message "Hello, Tomorrow!" to be displayed on the screen. Here fmt package has exported Println method which is used to display the message on the screen.
* Notice the capital P of Println method. In Go language, a name is exported if it starts with capital letter. Exported means the function or variable/constant is accessible to the importer of the respective package.

### Executing a Go Program 

Let us discuss how to save the source code in a file, compile it, and finally execute the program. Please follow the steps given below −

* Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.
* Save the file as hello.go
* Open the command prompt.
* Go to the directory where you saved the file.
* Type go run hello.go and press enter to run your code.
* If there are no errors in your code, then you will see "Hello Tomorrow!" printed on the screen.

 Make sure the Go compiler is in your path and that you are running it in the directory containing the source file hello.go.
 
 ## Basic Syntax
  After we konw the program structure of Go, now we can learn more about the building blocks of go programming language. 
 ### Tokens in Go 
 
 A Go program consists of various tokens. A token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following Go statement consists of six tokens −
 ```go
 fmt.Println("Hello, Tomorrow!")
 ```
 the six individual tokens are as follow-
 ```go
 fmt
.
Println
(
   "Hello, Tomorrow!"
)
 ```
 
 ### Line separator in GO 
 In a Go program, the line separator key is a statement terminator. compared with C programming language, individual statements in GO don't need a special separator like “;” . The Go compiler internally places “;” as the statement terminator to indicate the end of one logical entity.

For example, let us look at the following statements −
```go
fmt.Println("Hello, Tomorrow!")
fmt.Println("we have a better future!")
fmt.println("I am learning GO programming language!")
```
we can see that there is no special separator among individual statements in GO.
 
 ### identifiers 
 A Go identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter _A to Z_ or _a to z_ or an underscore _ followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).

identifier = letter { letter | unicode_digit }.

Go does not allow punctuation characters such as **@, $, #, % and &** within identifiers. Go is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, **Mahesh and mahesh are two different identifiers in Go**. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers −
```go
mahesh      kumar   abc   move_name   a_123
myname50   _temp    j      a23b9      retVal
``` 
### comments 
comments are helpful texts but are ingored by compilers, they start with /* and end with */ as follow:
```go
/* A new learner in GO */
```

## OpenStack from Go

Contributed by Gregor

There are multiple API interfaces that allow direct access to
elementary functionality to controll for example virtual machines in
Go. This includes GopgerCloud, and GolangClient. We describe them next.

### GohperCloud

GopherCloud is located at

* <https://github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud>

#### Authentication

To interact with OpenStack, yo will need to first authenticate with
your OpenSatck cloud. YOu will need to know your username and
password. However the example that we provide here is on intention
wrong to showcase you a better way. The example includes a hard coded
username and password, that actually is supposed to be either read in
via an interactive process or from a `~/.cloudmesh/cloudmesh.yaml`
file as we have used in our python cloudmesh code. We will use the
same format and obtain the information from that file. YOur task will
be to write a yaml file reader in go, get the information and modify
the program accordingly while improving this section with a pull
request.

```
import (
  "github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud"
  "github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/openstack"
  "github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/openstack/utils"
)

opts := gophercloud.AuthOptions{
  IdentityEndpoint: "https://openstack.example.com:5000/v2.0",
  Username: "{username}",
  Password: "{password}",
}
```

An alternative approach is to obtain the values from environment
variables

```
import (
  "github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud"
  "github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/openstack"
  "github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/openstack/utils"
)

opts, err := openstack.AuthOptionsFromEnv()
provider, err := openstack.AuthenticatedClient(opts)
```

We will at this time not use the second approach.

To start a virtual machine you need to first identify the location of
the client for the region you will use. This can be achieved wit the
command:

```
client, err := openstack.NewComputeV2(provider, gophercloud.EndpointOpts{
  Region: os.Getenv("OS_REGION_NAME"),
})
```

#### Virtual machines

Now that we know we can communicate through the client with the cloud,
we can create our first virtual machine, where flavor_id and image_id
are the approriate flavors and image ids:


```
import "github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/openstack/compute/v2/servers"

server, err := servers.Create(client, servers.CreateOpts{
  Name:      "gregor-001",
  FlavorRef: "flavor_id",
  ImageRef:  "image_id",
}).Extract()
```

Additional information can be found in the source code of GoherClient
which you can easily inspect. Soem useful documentation is also
provided in


#### Resources :o:

From <https://github.com/gophercloud/gophercloud/blob/master/doc.go>
we quote (we will need to rewrite this section as this is excessive quoting):

"

Resource structs are the domain models that services make use of in order
to work with and represent the state of API resources:

```
  server, err := servers.Get(client, "{serverId}").Extract()
  ```
  
Intermediate Result structs are returned for API operations, which allow
generic access to the HTTP headers, response body, and any errors associated
with the network transaction. To turn a result into a usable resource struct,
you must call the Extract method which is chained to the response, or an
Extract function from an applicable extension:

```
result := servers.Get(client, "{serverId}")
  // Attempt to extract the disk configuration from the OS-DCF disk config
  // extension:
  config, err := diskconfig.ExtractGet(result)
```
  
All requests that enumerate a collection return a Pager struct that is used to
iterate through the results one page at a time. Use the EachPage method on that
Pager to handle each successive Page in a closure, then use the appropriate
extraction method from that request's package to interpret that Page as a slice
of results:

```
err := servers.List(client, nil).EachPage(func (page pagination.Page) (bool, error) {
  s, err := servers.ExtractServers(page)
  if err != nil {
    return false, err
  }
  // Handle the []servers.Server slice.
  // Return "false" or an error to prematurely stop fetching new pages.
  return true, nil
})
```

If you want to obtain the entire collection of pages without doing any
intermediary processing on each page, you can use the AllPages method:

```
allPages, err := servers.List(client, nil).AllPages()
allServers, err := servers.ExtractServers(allPages)
```
    
This top-level package contains utility functions and data types that are used
throughout the provider and service packages. Of particular note for end users
are the AuthOptions and EndpointOpts structs.
