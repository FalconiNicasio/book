# Open API

## swagger
Swagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API.
With the largest ecosystem of API tooling on the planet, thousands of developers are supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment.
With a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability. We created Swagger to help fulfill the promise of APIs.
## features of GO swagger 
* Generates a server from a swagger specification
* Generates a client from a swagger specification
* Supports most features offered by jsonschema and swagger, including polymorphism
* Generates a swagger specification from annotated go code
* Additional tools to work with a swagger spec
* Great customization features, with vendor extensions and customizable templates
* Our focus with code generation is to produce idiomatic, fast go code, which plays nice with golint, go vet etc.
