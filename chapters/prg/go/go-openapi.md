# Open API :o: :question:

:warning: We have a large section previously on openapi, 
what needs to be done here is to showcase how to generate go 
from swagger codegen or other tool and use it


## serve specification UI 

Most basic use-case: serve a UI for your spec: 
```go 
swagger serve https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-expanded.json 
```

## validate a specification 

```go 
swagger validate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/master/examples/v2.0/json/petstore-expanded.json 
```

## Generate a Go OpenAPI server 

:warning: this is incorrect :o:
```go 
swagger generate server [-f ./swagger.json] -A [application-name [--principal [principal-name]]
```

## generate a Go OpenAPI client 

:warning: this is incorrect :o:

```go 
swagger generate client [-f ./swagger.json] -A [application-name [--principal [principal-name]]
```

## generate a spec from the source 

:warning: this is put here without explanation

```go 
swagger generate spec -o ./swagger.json 
```

## generate a data model 

:warning: this is put here without explanation

```go 
swagger generate model --spec={spec}
```
