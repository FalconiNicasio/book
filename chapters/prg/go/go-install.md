# Installation

TODO: always do 80 chars

TODO use qutes, for example `/etc/filename`

[Official binary distributions](https://golang.org/dl/) are available
for the FreeBSD (release 10-STABLE and above), Linux, macOS (10.10 and
above), and Windows operating systems and the 32-bit (386) and 64-bit
(amd64) x86 processor architectures.

If a binary distribution is not available for your combination of
operating system and architecture, try
[installing from source](https://golang.org/doc/install/source) or
[installing gccgo instead of gc](https://golang.org/doc/install/gccgo).

Go binary distributions are available for these supported operating
systems and architectures. Please ensure your system meets these
requirements before proceeding. If your OS or architecture is not on
the list, you may be able to install from source or use gccgo instead.

## Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD tarballs

[Download the archive](https://golang.org/dl/) and extract it into
/usr/local, creating a Go tree in /usr/local/go. For example:

```
tar -C /usr/local -xzf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz
```

Choose the archive file appropriate for your installation. For
instance, if you are installing Go version 1.2.1 for 64-bit x86 on
Linux, the archive you want is called go1.2.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz.

(Typically these commands must be run as root or through sudo.)

Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable. You can do
this by adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide
installation) or $HOME/.profile:

```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

**Note**: changes made to a profile file may not apply until the next
time you log into your computer. To apply the changes immediately,
just run the shell commands directly or execute them from the profile
using a command such as source $HOME/.profile.

## macOS package installer
[Download the package file](https://golang.org/dl/), open it, and
follow the prompts to install the Go tools. The package installs the
Go distribution to /usr/local/go.

The package should put the `/usr/local/go/bin` directory in your `PATH`
environment variable. You may need to restart any open Terminal
sessions for the change to take effect.

## Windows

The Go project provides two installation options for Windows users
(besides
[installing from source](https://golang.org/doc/install/source)): a
zip archive that requires you to set some environment variables and an
MSI installer that configures your installation automatically.

- MSI installer  
  Open the [MSI file](https://golang.org/dl/) and follow the prompts
  to install the Go tools. By default, the installer puts the Go
  distribution in c:\Go.

  The installer should put the c:\Go\bin directory in your PATH
  environment variable. You may need to restart any open command
  prompts for the change to take effect.

- Zip archive [Download the zip file](https://golang.org/dl/) and
  extract it into the directory of your choice (we suggest c:\Go).  If
  you chose a directory other than c:\Go, you must set the GOROOT
  environment variable to your chosen path.  Add the bin subdirectory
  of your Go root (for example, c:\Go\bin) to your PATH environment
  variable.


### Setting environment variables under Windows

Under Windows, you may set environment variables through the
"Environment Variables" button on the "Advanced" tab of the "System"
control panel. Some versions of Windows provide this control panel
through the "Advanced System Settings" option inside the "System"
control panel.

## Test your installation

Check that Go is installed correctly by setting up a workspace and
building a simple program, as follows.

Create your workspace directory, $HOME/go. (If you'd like to use a
different directory, you will need to set the GOPATH environment
variable.)

Next, make the directory src/hello inside your workspace, and in that
directory create a file named hello.go that looks like:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Printf("hello, world\n")
}
```

Then build it with the go tool:

```bash
$ cd $HOME/go/src/hello
$ go build
```

The command above will build an executable named hello in the
directory alongside your source code. Execute it to see the greeting:

```bash
$ ./hello
hello, world
```

If you see the "hello, world" message then your Go installation is
working.

You can run go install to install the binary into your workspace's bin
directory or go clean -i to remove it.

## Uninstallation

To remove an existing Go installation from your system delete the go
directory. This is usually /usr/local/go under Linux, macOS, and
FreeBSD or c:\Go under Windows.

You should also remove the Go bin directory from your PATH environment
variable. Under Linux and FreeBSD you should edit /etc/profile or
$HOME/.profile. If you installed Go with the macOS package then you
should remove the /etc/paths.d/go file. Windows users should read the
section about setting environment variables under Windows.
