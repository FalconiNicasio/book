Go is a programming language that has been introduced by Google to
replace the C++ language. Portions of this section have been adapted
from the [official Go Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/) [?].

The language Go has at its goal to be expressive, concise, clean, and
efficient. It includes concurrency mechanisms with the goal to make it
easy to write programs that can utilize multicore and networked
features of modern computer systems and infrastructure easily with
language features. However in contrast to languages such as python and
ruby, it introduces in addition to static types explicitly types
supporting concurrent programming such as channels that have already
been used in the early days of programming for example as part of CSP
[?] and OCCAM [?]

Go is compiled to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage
collection and the power of run-time reflection. It is designed to
provide the programmer a fast, statically typed, compiled language
that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.

Here is an example article discussing
[Why should you learn Go?](https://medium.com/exploring-code/why-should-you-learn-go-f607681fad65)[?]. However,
this article may be a bit biased towards Go and you may want to
evaluate some of the provided arguments more carefully yourself.

* :construction: TODO: It is highly unusual that we "quote" such a long paragraph from a
resource. We like to minimize such "quoting". Quoting, in this amount is viewed as
not a good way of writing a chapter.

Regarding the design philosophy behind the Go language, the following
is
[an excerpt from the designers](https://golang.org/doc/faq#principles):

> When Go was designed, Java and C++ were the most commonly used
> languages for writing servers, at least at Google. We felt that
> these languages required too much bookkeeping and repetition. Some
> programmers reacted by moving towards more dynamic, fluid languages
> like Python, at the cost of efficiency and type safety. We felt it
> should be possible to have the efficiency, the safety, and the
> fluidity in a single language.

> Go attempts to reduce the amount of typing in both senses of the
> word. Throughout its design, we have tried to reduce clutter and
> complexity. There are no forward declarations and no header files;
> everything is declared exactly once. Initialization is expressive,
> automatic, and easy to use. Syntax is clean and light on keywords.
> Stuttering (`foo.Foo* myFoo = new(foo.Foo`)) is reduced by simple type
> derivation using the `:=` declare-and-initialize construct. And
> perhaps most radically, there is no type hierarchy: types just are,
> they don't have to announce their relationships. These
> simplifications allow Go to be expressive yet comprehensible without
> sacrificing, well, sophistication.

> Another important principle is to keep the concepts orthogonal.
> Methods can be implemented for any type; structures represent data
> while interfaces represent abstraction; and so on. Orthogonality
> makes it easier to understand what happens when things combine.

According to the [TIOBE](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) [?] index
for programming languages Go has reached for November 2018 the 16th
spot. However it is rated only with 1.081% with a declining rating but
increase in the ranking. This trend is even more prominently depicted
when looking at google trends.

## Organization of the chapter.

The material presented in this chapter introduces the reader first to
the basic concepts and features of the Go language and system.  This
includes compiling (see Section ?), have a basic understanding of the
programming language (see Section ?), use standard library and become
familiar with package management (see Section ?). Next we will focus
on aspects of the Go language that are especially useful for Cloud
computing. This includes the review of how to develop REST services
with various frameworks such as Gorilla (see Section ?) and OpenAPI
(see Section ?). You will than be introduced on how to access virtual
machines (see Section ?) and containers (see Section ?).

In order to to use Go we recommend that you have a computer fulfilling
the following requirements:

- Have the most up to date version of Go installed
- Be familiar with the Linux command line as showcased in Section ?
- Familiarity with a text editor such as emacs, which we prefer as it
  supports nicely not only Go but any other language or document
  format we typically use in our activities. Alternatives are
  discussed in Section ?
