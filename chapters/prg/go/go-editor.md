# Editors Supporting Go :white_check_mark: {#s-go-editor}

A large number of editor compatibilities and plugins are listed at 

* <https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/IDEsAndTextEditorPlugins>

We recommend that you identify an editor form that list that will work for you.
Due to the universality of emacs and its use for managing LaTeX as ewll as bibtex,
we recommend that you use emacs,

However most likely any other editor on that list will work also.
