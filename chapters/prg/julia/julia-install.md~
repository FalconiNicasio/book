## Installing Julia
As an interactive, dynamically-typed language, there are many ways to run and
interact with Julia code, including directly in a browser using
<www.Juliabox.com>, which requires no installation. 

### Dependencies: 
First check to make sure that you have the required dependencies installed:
<https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia#required-build-tools-and-external-libraries>

On Ubuntu, you can easily install the required packages using the following
command [www-julialang]:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libatomic1 python gfortran perl wget m4
cmake pkg-config
```

To install Julia locally, first download and extract the appropriate 32 or 64-
bit binary installation package at <https://julialang.org/downloads/> into a
directory of your choice. You can then add Julia home to your PATH, or
include a soft reference by typing ```export PATH="$(pwd)/julia:$PATH"``` or by
editing your ```/etc/environment``` file. [www-julialang]

Alternatively, you can use Linux's Personal Package Archive:
<https://launchpad.net/~staticfloat/+archive/ubuntu/juliareleases> and issuing
the following commands: 
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:staticfloat/juliareleases
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:staticfloat/julia-deps
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install julia
```

You should now be able to activate Julia in your Bash session by typing
```$ julia```
