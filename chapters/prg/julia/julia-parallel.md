## Parallel Computing

Though not intended as a replacement for Hadoop, parallelism in Julia is fairly
straight-forward. [www-wired]

### Coroutines, or Tasks. 
### Multi-threading,
### Green-threading
### Hadoop and Julia:

Julia is also optimized for high performance computing in a distributed
environment. While development and interactivity between Spark, Hadoop, and
Julia is robust, the documentation is limited. The Elly.jl package [@elly-jl]
is a Hadoop and Yarn client for Julia. We focus here on the Hadoop
functionality.
