A user can interact with Julia in several ways; through an interactive or non-
interactive command-line sessions, by using a local notebook similar to iPython
/Jupyter, or through a browser by going to JuliaBox.org.
Julia has several APIs available, and can communicate with Python, C, and Java.

### Java:
Julia interacts with Java through the use of the JavaCall.jl package.
[@javacall] "Static and instance method with primitve or object arguments and 
return values are callable." [@javacall].
