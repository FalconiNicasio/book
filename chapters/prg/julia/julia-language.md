# Julia :o: :question:

:warning: Although we do not intend to use julia in this class, we
provid the option for a small number of students to develop this
chapter as part of the course requirements. In case you chose it, you
could also investigate how to use the cloud from it as to potentially
do your project in julia. Your project would be to develop a cloud
client in julia similar to the one we developed in pythin under the
name cloudmesh.


This chapter can be contributed by one or multiple students

* External programs
A user can interact with Julia in several ways; through an interactive or non-
interactive command-line sessions, by using a local notebook similar to iPython
/Jupyter, or through a browser by going to JuliaBox.org.
Julia has several APIs available, and can communicate with Python, C, and Java.
