## Recording Audio with Autoplay

In some classes you may be asked to prepare a presentation that can be
played at any time with recorder audio. Powerpoint provides such a
mechanism, while allowing to combine the audio for each page to a
consecutive recording.

To help you achieve this, we have provided the following simple
demonstration.

## Markdown to PPTX

`Pandoc` provides the ability to simply export markdown to power
point. This could be useful for transitioning or first developing
content in markdown to powerpoint. Simply use

```
pandoc filename.md -o fiename.pptx
```

and you will convert the markdown to a simple powerpoint that you can
than improve. The initial improvement is best doen in the overview
mode of powerpoint so you can organize the bullet points and slides
better incase the pagination is not done right.
