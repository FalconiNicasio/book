# Hadoop using Docker :o:

Apache Hadoop 3.0.1 is the latest release (25 March, 2018) which
includes significant enhancements over the previous version of Hadoop
2.x.

This section provides a separated Dockerfile to build hadoop 3.0.1 but
the configurations and examples are same except a few minor changes
which are:

* CentOS 7
* systemctl
* Java SE Development Kit 8

## Draft: Building Hadoop 3.0.1 using Docker

Build a docker image by Dockerfile from:

```bash
$ mkdir hadoop3.0.1
$ cd hadoop3.0.1
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudmesh/book/master/examples/docker/hadoop/3.0.1/Dockerfile
$ docker build -t cloudmesh/hadoop:3.0.1 .
```
    
The complete docker image for Hadoop 3.0.1 consumes the storage size of
1.5GB.

```bash
$ docker images
```

```bash
REPOSITORY                      TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
cloudmesh/hadoop                3.0.1               ba2c51f94348        20 hours ago        1.5GB
```

## Start a Hadoop Container with Interactive Shell

```bash
$ docker run -it cloudmesh/hadoop:3.0.1 /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash
$ %docker run -it lee212/e222 /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash
```

The details of the new version is available from the official site here:
http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.0.1/index.html

## Examples

The statistics and PageRank examples are identical to the Section
[Hadoop 2.7.5 on Docker]({#s-hadoop-docker-2})



## DUPLICATION

This Dockerfile builds Hadoop Docker container with CentOS base image and
contains examples to run Hadoop such as statistics like WordCount and PageRank.

### Build

```bash
$`docker build -t cloudmesh/hadoop:3.0.1 .`
```

### Run

```bash
`docker run -it cloudmesh/hadoop:3.0.1 /etc/bootstrap.sh -bash`
```

### PageRank Example

Find instruction and source code to run in the following directory:

`/cloudmesh/pagerank`

### Hadoop Configuration Files

The configuration files are shared with Hadoop 2.7.5.

### Virtual Memory Limit

Increase memory limit in the mapred-site.xml, for example:

- mapreduce.map.memory.mba to 4096
- mapreduce.reduce.memory.mb to 8192

### hdfs Safemode leave command

```bash
$ hdfs dfsadmin -safemode leave`
```
