# Django REST Framework

Django REST framework is a large toolkit to develop Web APIs. The
developers of the framework provide the following reasons for using it:

> "(1) The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.
> (2) Authentication policies including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
> (3) Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources. (4)
> Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if
> you do not need the more powerful features. (5) Extensive documentation,
> and great community support. (6) Used and trusted by internationally
> recognised companies including Mozilla, Red Hat, Heroku, and
> Eventbrite."
