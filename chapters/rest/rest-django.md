# Django REST Framework

Django REST framework is an extensive toolkit to develop Web APIs. The
developers of the framework provide the following reasons for using it
according to the developers of that module:

> 1. The Browsable Web API improves usability.
> 2. Authentication policies, including packages for OAuth1a and OAuth2.
> 3. Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources. 
> 4. Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if
>   you do not need the more powerful features. 
> 5. Extensive documentation,
>   and great community support. 
> 6. Used and trusted by internationally
> recognized companies including Mozilla, Red Hat, Heroku, and
>   Eventbrite."

To document your Django framework with Swagger, you can look at this example:

However, we believe that for our purpose the approach to use conexion
from an OpenAPI is much more appealing, also using conexion and also flask for the REST service is easier to accomplish. Django is a large
package that will take more time to get used to.
