# Google IaaS Cloud Services :o: :question:

Google Cloud, offered by Google, is a suite of cloud computing
services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses
internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search and
YouTube. Alongside a set of management tools, it provides a series of
modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data
analytics and machine learning. Registration requires a credit card or
bank account details. Pricing is on a pay-as-you-go per second basis, 
and discounts are offered for certain services that run for extended periods. 
A free trial of $300 worth of services is available for the first 12 months. 
Many services are always free up to a certain amount of use. 

Google Cloud Platform provides Infrastructure as a Service, Platform
as a Service, and Server-less Computing environments.

Google Cloud Platform is a part of Google Cloud, which includes the
Google Cloud Platform public cloud infrastructure, as well as G Suite, Cloud Identity, Apigee, Firebase,
enterprise versions of Android and Chrome OS, and Google Maps Platform. See @fig:gcloud-services
