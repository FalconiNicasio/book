### Cutting: Using Fusion 360 and a Laser Cutter

### Preparing and Using the Laser Cutter

Turning on laser cutter

Instructor demonstrates how to turn the laser cutter on and carry out other preparations to learners while operating the laser cutter.

1. Turn the laser cutteron. 

   Use key to turn on the laser cutter.

3. Turning the exhaust fan on.  T

   The fan is a separately switched unit. Turn on the switch on the wall next to the laser cutter.

   Question is raised: What is the possible risk of not ensuring the exhaust fan is running during laser cutter operation?
   
   TODO: Insead of doing this question, just provide the answer

3. Putting cutting material onto the laser cutterbed

   The instructor puts the cutting material onto the laser cutter bed.
   
   Question is raised: What will you do if the cutting material is smaller than the honeycomb bed? How will you place it?

FIX FORMAT .....

Instructor will demonstrate the use of each button. The middle top one is on- hold button, one can press it to save the power of the laser cutter.
The start/pause button can be used to pause a job in the middle. Once you start from a paused state the job resumes.
The stop button will cancel the job. You will need to restart the job from the beginning if this button is pressed to stop a job.
The four buttons on the bottom left controls the x/y horizontal shift of the laser head. The other two controls the z-axis, or vertical movement of the cutting bed.
Questions raised: What is the difference between stop and pause button?
f. Focusing the laser head
Instructor will move the laser head above the cutting material, then will place the focusing tool on the laser head. Then the instructor carefully raises the cutting bed. When the focusing tool touches the material on the bed it will fall off indicating the laser is focused.

Questions raised: What might be a risk of raising the cutting bed too quickly?
Sending file to job control software and initiate cutting
a. SendfiletoJobControl
The instructor open the saved file in Adobe Illustrator. Then the instructor clicks print in it to set the printer to “Trotec Laser Cutter”.
b. Setlasercuttingparameters
The instructor will change the width and height of the cutting area in the size column. By clicking the “Preferences” tab, the instructor can adjust the settings of different colors (traditionally red lines are for cutting and black lines and areas are for engraving)
c. Move file to Job Control work surface
Then the instructor could click on print to send file to the Job Control surface. Instructor will turn on Job Control software and discover the job is in the queue on the right of screen.
d. DragthefiletobecutontotheJobControlworksurfaceandsetitupin the upper right corner.
e. SelectthePlayarrowinJobControl
f. An exhaust warning will appear. Select OK. The job will start.
Questions raised:
What is the importance of setting cutting parameters?
What will you check before pressing the start button to ensure safety?
