## IU 100 Node Cluster Case :construction:

At Indiana University we have currently about 100 Raspberry Pi's
available for students that work with us as part of classes.

Our goal for the use of these PI's is multitude.

First, we naturally like that all PI's could be used together in a
large cluster. Second we like that student teams up to 3 students can
use a samll cluster of between 6 - 5 Pi's and use them to providsion
their own OS. Third, we like to crate a case and shelf structure that
allows this modular utilization of the cluster while breaking it down
easily, but also assembeling or adding to the cluster easily.

This section will document our efforts to support this. The section is
heavely under construction and currently two STEM students work on the
case. They are joined by an independent study student ofer the summer
that looks at the software for this cluster.

To simplify management we will be using github for managing tasks, but
we will start collecting these tasks here. At this time the STEM
students are using still a google docs document till they migrate to
this or their own github.

The outline of the section is as follows :construction:

### Takss for STEM students


TODO: look ad word document.  reformat this and make sure to put in
relevant information. The questions raised should be excersises?

### Designing in CAD for Laser 

We believe the best program for us to design a case for the cluster is
OpenSCAD. Links and tutorials to the software can be found here:

* <http://www.openscad.org/>
* <http://www.openscad.org/cheatsheet/>
* <https://github.com/RigacciOrg/openscad-rpi-library>
* <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WQd5db9lsQk>

Although OpenSCAD requires programming, it seems to be easier than
creating the design with a GUI based CAD program.

For this reason we will be using SCAD but mention other CAD software
next, that we however will not use for our case dedign.


The IU Maker Lab standard Software is Fusion 360 which is
available from 

* <https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview>

However it does require a license and alternative that can be used for
free. This includes FreeCAD 

* FreeCAD Software <https://www.freecadweb.org/>
* Freccad Documentation <https://www.freecadweb.org/wiki/Main_Page>

This program allows you to design the layout of a 3D case via a
sophisticated GUI just like Fusion 360. 



### Using the Laser Cutter

After you have designed your case, you can create it on the laser
cutter available at Indiana University. The laser cutter is located at

* TBD

and operated by

* McKay

You can get access to it by contacting ...

Once you have access you will be trained by ...

The first step includes to turning on laser cutter. An instructor 

First an instructor will demonstrate how to turn the laser cutter on
and carry out other preparation taskson how to operate the laser
cutter. Please get familiar but do not yet touch any buttons from the
laser cutter.

TODO Safety googles ...

Next the instructur will give you a walk through of the machine so you
can replicate thes steps next time.

1. Turn the laser cutter on: Use key to turn on the laser cutter.
2. Turn the exhaust fan on: The fan is a separately switched
   unit. Turn on the switch on the wall next to the laser
   cutter. :warning: It to turn on the exhaust in order to have proper
   ventilation during the cutting process.
3. Put the cutting material onto the laser cutterbed. The instructor
   puts the cutting material onto the laser cutter bed. In case the
   material is smaller than the honeycomb bed you will need to place
   is as follows TODO: TBD
4. The buttons for the laser cutter do the following

   1. The middle top one is on-hold
      button, one can press it to save the power of the laser cutter.
   2. The start/pause button can be used to pause a job in the
      middle. Once you start from a paused state the job resumes.
   3. The stop button will cancel the job. You will need to restart
      the job from the beginning if this button is pressed to stop a
      job.
   4. The four buttons on the bottom left controls the x/y horizontal
      shift of the laser head. The other two controls the z-axis, or
      vertical movement of the cutting bed. 

   Note that while the stop button stops the entire process, the pause
   button will halt the process so you can continue.
5. To properly cut the material, you will need to focusing the laser
   head. Move the laser head above the cutting material, then will
   place the focusing tool on the laser head. Then carefully raise the
   cutting bed. When the focusing tool touches the material on the bed
   it will fall off indicating the laser is focused. You must be
   careful to not rais ethe bed too fast in order not to damage the
   laser head.
6. Now we need to send the file to the job control software and
   initiate cutting

   1. Send the file to the Job Control by opening the saved file in
      Adobe Illustrator. TODO: how do we get the SCAD file into it,
      which format do we need. You click print and set the printer to
      "Trotec Laser Cutter".
   2. Set laser cutting parameter will be set to width and height of
      the cutting area in the size column. By clicking the
      “Preferences” tab, one can adjust the settings of different
      colors (traditionally red lines are for cutting and black lines
      and areas are for engraving)
   3. Move the file to Job Control work surface by turning on the Job
      Control software and discover the job is in the queue on the
      right of screen.
      
   4. Next drag the file to be cut on to the Job Control worksurface
      and setit up in the upper right corner.
   5. Select the Play arrow in JobControl
   6. An exhaust warning will appear. Select OK. The job will start.

Questions raised:
* What is the importance of setting cutting parameters?
* What will you check before pressing the start button to ensure safety?

### IU cluster Case design

We have designed the following cases

TBD

Right now we just put some templates here to showcase we can actually
generate the cases. More detalis will be added here soon.
