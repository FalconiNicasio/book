# Security Warning

:warning: **Chameleon cloud promotes insecure use of ssh while
suggesting passphrase less keys.** This is **very dangerous** due to
the fact that someone could gain access to your computer and if a
password less key is stolen easy access to other systems can be
achieved. Instead you must use whenever possible passphrases and use
ssh agent and ssh add!

To show you tis insecue practice, we quote from their
[Web page](https://chameleoncloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/faq.html?highlight=ssh#faq-ssh):

> You will receive a message “Enter same passphrase again:” so just
> leave it blank and press enter.

Hence do not use their advise that is mentioned multiple times in their
documentation. Follow ours, and use a passphrase!

# Resources

YOu can also visit the Chameleon Web page as there is also more
information about other topics that we may not need to worry about
. Furthermore we do not use Advanced Appliances, but use mostly
ansible instead as it is independent from OpenStack and can be used
with other frameworks.

If you prefer you can also go to the Chameleon Web site using the
following links. However we have improved some of the documentation
found in this document. We would like to get your feedback in case you
find errors or like to contribute tho this documentation.
