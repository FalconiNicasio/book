## FaaS :o:

### Introduction
FaaS or Function as a service is a new paradim in cloud computing that is gaining popularity recently. FaaS is also
known as Serverless Computing to some. While the name Serverless implies that no servers are involved this is not true. 
So FaaS would be a better term to describe this technology. FaaS is built around functions and events. Functions are
generally stateless and are executed within isolated containers. The execution of the functions can be thought of as an 
event driven model. A program or application in FaaS consist of a set of functions and a set of events or triggers that 
invoke or activate those functions. A function activation can result in another function activation as a result. 

Generally FaaS specifies a set of constraints on what a function can be. The constraints include storage constraints 
such as a maximum size for the function, maximum memory allowed, execution time, etc. The exact constraints differ from
provider to provider. AWS Lambda is considered as one of first FaaS offerings. Now most cloud providers offer their own
version of FaaS. Several popular FaaS providers are listed below.
