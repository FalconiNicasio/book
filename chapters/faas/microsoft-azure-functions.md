# Microsoft Azure Function

 Microsoft Azure Functions [@azure_serverless_computing] is the Microsoft's take 
 on serverless computing. Similar to its counterparts such as AWS Lambda ([@sec:aws-lambda]), 
 Google Cloud Functions ([@sec:google-cloud-functions]), it provides, an 
 event-driven serverless compute platform which can deploy and operate 
 FaaS services at scale in the cloud, and integrate services using triggers and 
 bindings.

To get started with Azure Functions, you would first need to create an Azure 
subscription (a usual requirement for all Azure cloud offerings). Then you can 
create a function (FaaS service) on .NET, JavaScript, Java or Python. Azure 
provides quickstart guides for all these languages. Additionally Azure supports 
languages such as C#, F#, PowerShell, TypeScript etc. For further information, 
please refer to the [Azure Cloud Functions documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions) [@azure_functions_docs]
