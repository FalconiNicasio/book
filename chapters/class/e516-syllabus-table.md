## Proposed Lecture Timeline

The times indicate when to start a particular technology documentation
or lecture. It may take you some weeks to complete some of the
sections. If you know the topic well, it may take you less time so you
should move ahead. For example while it may take some time for some
to learn python, others have the knowledge already and should move on.
The book can be used as reference material in that case.

Students need only to do one project. The project is conducted thought
the entire semester.


* Dates may change as the semester evolves

* The project is a long term assignment (and are ideally worked on
weekly by residential students). It is the major part of the course
grade.

(*) Sections and chapters prepare you for documenting a technical aspect related
to cloud computing. It is a preparation for a document that explains
how to execute your project in a reproducible manner to others.

- all times are in EST

Additional lectures will be added that allow easy management of the project. 
These lectures can be taken any time when needed.

## Group Breakdown Checkpoint

Please note that all checkins in case of group projects are visible in
github. If we detect that a group member has disproportionally fewer
contributions to the project that other project team members we will
invite the team for a special section in which each team member needs
to explain what has been done. This is to avoid that a team member
unfairly relies on other team members and does not contribute to the
project. E.g. a project containing for example 3 members should
contribute the work of 3 team members and not fewer. This also means
that if you want to work in a project you need to vet your team
members. Do chose them based on capability and make sure they are a
good fit for your project.
