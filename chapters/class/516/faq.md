### Please read the FAQ

Before asking a question, please read the FAQ here and on Piazza to find
answers or engage in dicussions that result in answers.

### Where do I find the material for this class?

* <https://piazza.com/class/jzkfveoqwri3e4>

### Where to find the weekly agenda?

We have lecture notes for this class distributed as epub and PDF. We
recommend creating for the link shortcuts in your Web browser so
you can click on them quickly. However, all resources are posted at

* <https://piazza.com/iu/spring2020/e516spring2020/resources>

You can find all links and more also at 
 
* <https://laszewski.github.io>
 
### When do the online meetings take place?

TBD: see: <https://piazza.com/iu/spring2020/e516spring2020/resources>

Online meetings are for residential students not a substitute for the
Friday Meetings.


### Why switch the computer to English language mode?

We will not support any student that is not using English in the
language setting in their computer because we can not read it. You can
set it back after the meetings.

### Why should I not use dark mode 

Be kind to people with vision problems. The "dark" mode has become
really popular. However, it has some really big disadvantage. Those of
us which are having poor vision can not see the light font on the black
background.

So if you like to effectively work with those that have vision issues
you must use a white background and dark fonts.

> *This has now become a requirement and not an option.*

I atetndedn now several sessions in which I could not read the screen
due to the use of black background. This is valid for pycharm as well as
the terminal you use to execute your programs. You can switch back after
a zoom meeting.

We will immediatly stop support if you use dark themes and move on to
other students.

CMD.exe can easily be switched to light mode with `color f0`

### Wait until Gregor says `ENTER`

When working with Gregor, on installs try to be patient and
WAIT TILL HE SAYS ENTER.

### Character names on the keyboard

We use the following names

* `~` = tilde or twiddle or squiggly
* '#` = hash
* ':' = colon
* '[]' = sqaure braket based on when context is clear we just say bracket
* '{}' = curly braket based on when context is clear we just say bracket
* '()' = round bracket based on when context is clear we just say bracket 
* '<>' = angle bracket based on when context is clear we just say bracket 
* '<>' = url bracket based on when context is clear we just say bracket 

### Where can I find the recordings of the online meetings?

The meeting recordings are generally available two days after the
meeting. However, jf the books include the information, we may opt not
to publish them and instead refer to the book.

The recordings are added to the Lecture notes.

### Do I need to read the class material to take the class?

Yes, this is a real question from a past student. IU does not offer
classes that give you a certificate without understanding the material.
To understand it, you must start by reading it. 

### Does this class have a midterm and final?

Although we do not have a final or midterm, we do have deliverables for
the class. These deliverables will be clearly stated in the Lecture
notes.

This the answe is yes, but it will not be an exam and includes the
review of your graded assignments.

### Balance your classes.

This class requires at minimum 6 hours a week. We state this explicitly
as we often find students with the wrong impression that they can spend
100% of a wekes time on other classes. Please set 6 hours aside and make
sure you realy do it. If you finish in a week in less time, please
conduct additional work. This class is designed so that you do spend 6
hours per week no matetr what.

### When is the last day of this class?

The last day of class is May 8th.

### Will you provide support during the Spring break?

There should not be a reason for this as you need to work during the
semester and will be likely in good shape if you continiuosly work.
However it may be possible to provide support hours. They typically can
be scheduled on request between 9-10am during the Spring break.

The Mon, Tue 8-9pm meeting will take place upon request The residential
class fduring the spring break is canceled, you can request to attend
the online meetings.

The meetings must be requested 1-2 working days ahead. Ther ei sno
gurantee that I am in meetings if they are not confirmed. Cancelations
of meetings may be possible.

### Lab: Why can I not solve an assignment in 2 minutes?

In some cases, it takes you a **considerable** effort to research the
answer. An example is the Datacenter question about energy consumption
or cost. It is not expected that google may return a result quickly. You
may need to consider other publications such as google scholar, or
professional journals. If you, after some hours, have not found an
answer, maybe there exists no such answer. Check what other students
have done and ask them how they found the information. Remember, this
class is a community. Discuss on Piazza.

### Lab: How much time do I need to spend on each question?

This question can not be answered as it depends on the question. Some
questions may take hours. The time students typically spend on this
class is 6-8 hours. However, sometimes it may be less or more dependent
on your background. Please be reminded that many students with many
different backgrounds attend this class. For example, if we ask you to
do some python programming, and you have no background in Python, that
task may take you longer than someone who has Python background.
However, after you have done some Python tasks, the next python task
will be easier. Let us assume you do not know Python, but it took you
only 1 hour to do the assignments for the week, we recommend that you do
the rest of the time to learn Python. This way , when the python
assignment starts you are a Python expert also.

### I do not understand Piazza?

Attend the online hours and ask questions there or watch the recorded
online meetings as we explained it there also.

### Why you should not read the Piazza mail but use `Click Here` instead?

Piazza sends you e-mails. You can control the frequency in the piazza
settings. However, sometimes we do make corrections to the post after
you received the e-mail. To prevent any issues, we do recommend that
instead of reading the e-mail, you just use the click here feature,
which is placed on top of each mail.

This way, you are up to date instead of looking at a potenially outdated
e-mail. I activated e-mail notifications, so you have the best f these
two modes.

### Can I search in the ePub reader?

Yes, consult the Help in your epub readers' documentation.

### Where do I find the GitHub directory?

See <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community> and search for your name.
It will take some time to set up your repository. A form will be sent to
you that asks you to give us your github.com account. Be reminded that
we use github.com and not IU GitHub, which has, in the past, been
unreliable. Thus, if you do not have an account on github.com, please
create one now.

The repository will be created for you after you filled out the survey. 
It will take some time as this is a a process done by the instructor.

YOu will know that your repository has been created as you will receive
an e-mail from github to the email address that you have registered in
github. If you do not received an e-mail it may be in your spam or junk
folder.

YOu can also go to the repository and browse through them and locate the 
one under your name.

If it is there you need to accept the invitation if you have not 
done so via the e-mail.
This is easy: 

1. Locate your repository in https://github.com/cloudmesh-community
2. Lets assume you have number sp20-516-000
3. Go to https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/sp20-516-000/invitations
4. Accept the invitation

### Where can I find the hid directory?

We often refer to the GitHub directory as the hid directory, see *Where
to find the GitHub directory?*

### Do I need the futuresystems.org account?

No.

## Hardware and Software Related Questions

### Can I use my work computer for this class?

Please discuss this with your company. 

Every year we have bad experiences with students that use a work
computer. THis is not always the case, but frequently firewall are
installed. programms that blok execution or other restrictions are
imposed on the machine. Therfore we have decided, to not provide any
support for any student using a work computer even if you have
administrative priviledges. Only if you are completely responsible for
the machine we will provide suggestions. The first one we have is: buy a
back up drive, by another one from which you doal biit and leave your
work partition alone. 

Another one is if this does not work use a virtual machine in the cloud.

Or find a different computer that you have full control about?

### How much menmory have these days development computers?

Development computers these days have 16GB, however you can get away
likely with 8G. 

### What HardDrive do you recommend?

SSD. 

### Can I use Windows 1809?

No. it is broken and will not work. Do not even try!

### Rasperry PI Cluster Components 

Please help with your suggestions.

This is only relevant for those that want to use the PI as a project.

Residential students will get a cluster for the duration of the class
that they can take home.
 
Next we describe the components that are needed to create a cluster yourself

We are collecting in this spreadsheet information about which components
are needed for a raspberry pi cluster.  We estimate a cluster costs
about $333.32

* <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bK6XssA_1NStsAkyxYBuzwmXOVxXEt-oIkvKoqz91L4/edit?usp=sharing>

Those that select it as project and can come to the building I am in and
can get a cluster with up to 5 nodes for the duration. We have about 200
PIs. We have PI3B and PI3B+. We do not have the newer Pi4s which are
much much nicer. So if you buy make sure to get PI4's. We will, however,
have about 5 PI4's close to my office which you can use in the building
(they are on order)
 
We will make changes to the spreadsheet based on your feedback. You can
play with the count. When ordering a PI4 I recommend to get the 4GB
version. That is the best price point. 

The only thing that is a bit open is the power supply. For the cluster
in the building, we elected to use an Anker multi USB power supply.
However, you will need a cable and it may just be cheaper for you to buy
the standard power supplies for the pi4s. I found one on amazon that
even has a switch.

Networking may be able to be used from your modem. However, its
worthwhile to think about a separate switch.

You can also go with less than 4GB for the Pi version, but the 4GB seems
in my view the best value in my view.


### Which operating system can we use for class?

* macOS 10.14.8 or newer  
* Ubuntu 18.04
* Ubuntu 19.10
* Windows 10 EDU >= 1903
* Windows 10 PRO >= 1903
* any up to date Debian distribution
* CentOS (recent)
* Fedora (recent)
* Raspbian (newest) for Pi

We recommend at thsi time Ubuntu over Centos and Fedora as many have
experience with Ubuntu.

The following OS are not usable

* Windows 7 or 8
* iOS
* Android

### What do I need to run Hyper-V for Windows?

You need 

1. Windows 10 Enterprise, Pro, or Education.
2. 64-bit Processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT).
3. CPU support for VM Monitor Mode Extension (VT-c on Intel CPUs).
4. Minimum of 4 GB memory.

Check your system if your computer fulfills these requirements. If not
there is no need to even try! You will have to look up your computer
specifications and google if 2 and 3 apply

Here is the link about this:

* <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v>

### Where can I get Windows 10 EDU for free?

* <https://iuware.iu.edu/Windows/Title/2977>

After instalation you must update it. make sure you have at least 1909

### Can I run multipass in Windows 10 Home?

yes. See the documentation in out Cloud computing book and use
"virtualbox" as a driver. you must install virtualbox on your system.

* <https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/installing-multipass-for-windows/9547>


### What Software will in need for this class?

The software can not be listed up front as it may change during the
semester.

Here what we know at this time:

Required:

* Epub reader (OSX Books, All others Calibre or alternative you find)

* Python 3.8.1 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
* On Windows: ssh, Visual C++ Build Tools CLI, gitbash, multipass
* On OSX: xcode
 
Optional, but the best Python editor:

* Pycharm community version <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>
 

Optional, but we will use this to introduce you to some programming
concepts:

* Multipass: <https://multipass.run/   
  if multipass does not work, you can use the all powerful `print` 
  statement ;-)
 
### What is the best editor for class?

Pycharm, but it uses a lot of memory

### Can I use VS-Code?

Yes but it has lots of features missing:

* <https://tzutalin.blogspot.com/2019/04/set-up-visual-studio-code-for-python-in.html>

For group projects pyCharm code inspect is very nice and keeps code
uniform. Hence we do not recommend using VS-Code for python development
in this class.

##@ What is the best way to use pycharm for the class 

First clone your hid repository. Make sure you follow our instructions
and pu it in a folder cm so its easier for you to follow our
instructions.

```bash
$ cd ~
$ mkdir cm
$ cd cm
$ git clone sp20-516-00
$ cd sp20-516-00
```


When using pycharm you do not create a new project, instead, you use
`Open`.  Now browse to the `cm` folder (not the hid folder) and chose the
cm folder. 

### What aare the bigges issues we noticed?

1. Not taking time to fill out a form
2. Forgetting a password
3. Chameleon Cloud account creation bug
4. Not updating configuration files
5. Not updateing the software
6. Spending all your time on another class


## Markdown

### What is the best editor for bibliographies?

1. jabref
2. emacs

Please stay away from endnote, it used to have significant stability
issues.

### Can I just creat an empty .bib file?

No. under no circumstances create an empty bib file. you must put at
least one bibtex entry in it before committing to github, otherwise our
automated scripts that use pando break.

### What is an :o2: in the markdown file?

This indicates an issue that you must fix.

### How to set the columnwidth in pycharm to 80 characters?

We require you to format all markdown in 80 character width text. THis
can be enabled in pycharm and a shortcut can be created to invoke it on
a paragraph level.

For Pycharm 2019.3 version on MacOS, you can go to 

`PyCharm -> preferences -> Editor -> Code Style -> Markdown`

I set 'Hard Wrap at' to be 80 to follow PEP-8 style guide. 

Also set 'wrap on typing' to be Yes allowing lines to breake
automatically whan you write.

See also our cloudmesh manual for code conventions:

* <https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/dev/manual.html#documentation-management>


### What is a good spellshecker for markdown?

Grammarly.

### Why must i not use the words bellow and above in markdown

Please note that according to publishers such as OReiley the word
"bellow: and "above" are forbidden to be used in documentation. So never
use these words again. As we publish our documents in epub below and
above absolutely do not make any sense as the content floats and is
potentially on different pages dependent on your output device.

### Why must I avoid screenshots for terminal output?

Please note that is is not allowed to use
screenshots of terminals and we must use Copy and paste and use markdown code mode to frame it. 
Obfiously we can search in text, but not in eimages as part of epub or markdown. 

## Epub and Document Related Questions



### Is there an epub reader for chrome?

A student reported this works well:

How to install"

1. Open Chrome
2. Click on the 'Apps' icon
3. Go to Google Chrome's 'Web store'
4. Search 'epub reader'
5. Make sure you install the one with the following logo shown in @fig:epubreader-chrome
6. Open an epub file (either saved on drive or clicking on a link)
7. Mouse over the bottom to find settings in the reader
8. Set your column width to your desire and match of your screen resolution
9. Enjoy

![EPub reader](images/epubreader.png){#fig:epubreader-chrome}

Sometimes its worth while to clear the cache. There is also a useful
utility for chrome that can do this:

* <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clear-cache/cppjkneekbjaeellbfkmgnhonkkjfpdn>

It will install a recyceling icon that when you press on it clear the
cache for the currently displayed URL.
