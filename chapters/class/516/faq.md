## When do the online meetings take place?

TBD: see: <https://piazza.com/iu/spring2020/e516spring2020/resources>


Online meetings are for residential students not a substitute for the
Friday Meetings.

## Where can I find the recordings of the online meetings?

The meeting recordings are generally available two days after the
meeting. However, jf the books include the information, we may opt not to
publish them and instead refer to the book.

The recordings are added to the Lecture notes.

## Do I need to read the class material to take the class?

Yes, this is a real question from a past student. IU does not offer
classes that give you a certificate without understanding the material.
To understand it, you must start by reading it. 

## Lab: Why can I not solve an assignment in 2 minutes?

In some cases, it takes you a **considerable** effort to research the
answer. An example is the Datacenter question about energy consumption
or cost. It is not expected that google may return a result quickly. You may
need to consider other publications such as google scholar, or
professional journals. If you, after some hours, have not found an
answer, maybe there exists no such answer. Check what other students
have done and ask them how they found the information. Remember, this
class is a community. Discuss on Piazza. 

## Lab: How much time do I need to spend on each question?

This question can not be answered as it depends on the question. Some
questions may take hours. The time students typically spend on
this class is 6-8 hours. However, sometimes it may be less or more
dependent on your background. Please be reminded that many students with many different backgrounds attend this class. For
example, if we ask you to do some python programming, and you have no
background in Python, that task may take you longer than someone who has
Python background. However, after you have done some Python tasks, the
next python task will be easier. Let us assume you do not know Python,
but it took you only 1 hour to do the assignments for the week, we
recommend that you do the rest of the time to learn Python. This way
, when the python assignment starts you are a Python expert also.

## I do not understand Piazza?

Attend the online hours and ask questions there or watch the recorded
online meetings as we explained it there also.

## Why you should not read the Piazza mail but use `Click Here` instead?

Piazza sends you e-mails. You can control the frequency in the
piazza settings. However, sometimes we do make corrections to the post
after you received the e-mail. To prevent any issues, we do recommend
that instead of reading the e-mail, you just use the click here feature, which is placed on top of each mail.

This way, you are up to date instead of looking at a potenially outdated
e-mail. I activated e-mail notifications, so you have the best f these
two modes.

## Can I search in the ePub reader?

Yes, consult the Help in your epub readers' documentation.

## Where do I find the GitHub directory?

See <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community> and search for your name.
It will take some time to set up your repository. A form will be sent to
you that asks you to give us your github.com account. Be reminded that
we use github.com and not IU GitHub, which has, in the past, been
unreliable. Thus, if you do not have an account on github.com, please
create one now.

## Where can I find the hid directory?

We often refer to the GitHub directory as the hid directory, see *Where
to find the GitHub directory?*
