# Communication

## Class Material

Most class material is distributed as ePubs and PDF or resources on the
Web. Our ePubs render on many computers very nicely. Thus we recommend you
use ePub instead of the PDF versions of our documents. Please install an
ePub Reader if your system does not have one.

  * macOS: has a build ePub reader called Books. 
  * Windows 10: [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)
  * Linux: [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)
  * Others: Linux: [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)
  
Naturally, you can read the ePubs also on your tablets instead of on your
computers, if you have a tablet with lots of memory.

Please be aware that the documents will be updated weekly, and you need
to download them accordingly. Make sure you clear the cache if your
browser prevents the download of the newest version.

## Piazza

This class uses Piazza for communication. It is your responsibility to
enroll in the Piazza for the class. A link to our Piazza is provided in
CANVAS. Piazza works just like a forum in which you can ask questions or
post notes. In case of a question, students and teachers can formulate
answers. A thread system in the question can be used to gather the
answer.

You will get a grade for participation in the class discussions on
Piazza. Please note that we do not recommend you go from CANVAS to
Piazza as CANVAS has an bad HTML layout and in fact, does not allow you to see
the Piazza hyperlinks. Instead, go to Piazza directly. Use our link.

## Class Resources

All class material will be posted at

* <https://piazza.com/iu/spring2020/e516spring2020/resources>

## Online Meeting

If you are an online student:

A poll has been posted that you must fill out before Friday of the first
week of the semester for possible meeting times.

will also appear in CANVAS. You can find the link to them in our
resource section:

Please investigate what a formal Bio is. 

## Evolving Document

This document is improved throughout the semester with weekly
activities. We recommend that you regularly download a new version. Be
aware that some browsers or ePub readers may cache the previous version.
Thus make sure to check out the newest version.


## Books

This class does not use books from publishers as cloud computing is
constantly changing, and by the time you place the purchase order, the
book may already be outdated. Instead, we have prepared online books
that are continually evolving. It is even expected that tools or
services you use will evolve during the semester. 

We have the following books in ePub and PDF available. The ePub version
is our preferred version:

* [List of Books](https://laszewski.github.io/#books)

The weekly Lecture notes are contained at

* [e516: Cloud Computing Engineering](https://laszewski.github.io/book/e516/)


This page will bring you to the following books that we use as part of
e516. It will also clearly specify which assignments you need to do as
part of the weekly Lab activities.

* [Cloud Computing](https://laszewski.github.io/book/cloud/)
* [Linux](https://laszewski.github.io/book/linux/)
* [Python](https://laszewski.github.io/book/python/)
* [Markdown](https://laszewski.github.io/book/writing/)

## You Get Credit for Improving the Books

Please note that improving the document in GitHub via pull requests will
get you credits. This is an easy opportunity for you to get an excellent
grade.

## Ongoing Agenda

![Construction](images/warning.png)  We will add here weekly
the topics and Labs that we will cover in the coming week(s). Please be
aware that just as in regular lectures, we add the agenda items and
follow the syllabus. We may change the order of the topics covered in
the syllabus as appropriate.
