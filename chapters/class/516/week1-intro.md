## Lab Activities

Summary: 

* Post your professional bio to Piazza
* Setup your computer
* Create the cloud accounts and fill out the form [Cloud Accounts](https://forms.gle/UFr5FcdPcVFwcMvk8)
* Install python on your computer (Python 3.8)
* Update pip
* Install an ePub Reader
  * macOS: Build-in use Books
  * Windows 10: Build in use edge
  * others: [Calibre](https://forms.gle/w6ryzEm56rQmwWT38)

Next, we provide some more details. If you have questions, ask on 
[Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jzkfveoqwri3e4)

### Account Creation

As part of the class, you will need a number of accounts. This
includes:

* piazza.com (used for communication)
* github.com (used for the project and other class artifacts)
* chameleoncloud.org (free cloud account)
* futuresystems.org (GPU & container)

  * Please join this [project](https://portal.futuresystems.org/project/fg-569)

After you created the accounts, please fill out the following form so we
can set up the class accounts and in case of GitHub we create you a
class repository for you.

* [Cloud Accounts](https://forms.gle/UFr5FcdPcVFwcMvk8)

Optional accounts (apply once you need them, some are time limited):

* google.com (optional)
* aws.com (optional)
* azure.com (optional)
* Watson from IBM (optional)
* google Iaas (optional)

We will never ask you for your passwords.

### Bio

This activity serves two purposes. First, it tells us we can communicate
with you within [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jzkfveoqwri3e4), and
second, you can introduce yourself to others in Piazza to potentially
build project or study teams.

### Python 3.8

Please set up a computer on which you can do Python development. We
recommend that you use python from <http://python.org>. We will not
provide any support for anaconda, as anaconda has hundreds of libraries that
we are not interested in using. Also note that conda modifies your
environment without telling you. Certainly, you can use virtualbox, or
containers in case you like to isolate your development environment from
your other systems. Please remember that conda has significant
disadvantages while often working with outdated libraries. As the developer of
future software, you certainly want to avoid this. If you use python from
python.org we require you that you use venv.

The manual may have references to older versions of python. Also it
could be that some services do not work in newer python versions yet. It
will be your responsibility to find that out and makes sure the services
you use have an appropriate python version. We will not accept any
project targeting Python 2 or smaller than Python 3.7.4. You must use
pip version 19.3.1 or newer.

### Questionnaire

In this activity, you will be filling out a form with information about
you so we can assess how to integrate you in this class best. It is not
important that you know any of the technologies we ask you about.

:o2: Questionaire is not yet set up!

## Online Meeting Recording

This recording is from last year, but still useful. However, the links
in that presentation have been changed. We will be recording a new
lecture in the first week of the class.
