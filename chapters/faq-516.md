## Why have the individual lectures been removed from the resources section?

We identified that someone after almost three weeks has not looked at
the ePub and missed valuable information. To force students to look at
the epub we have removed the direct links to the md files in piazza
`Resources` section. Instead we still leave the links to the md file
sin the syllabus so that you can still get to them from the syllabus.
This way also room for error is minimized as we only have to update
one file wit the location and not two.

The little clouds in the ePub are automatically created and provide
a direct link to the md file for which the content follows.

Essentially instead of making it real convenient not to read the epub,
we make it now real convenient that you read it while *hiding* the
inks a bit in the syllabus md file.
