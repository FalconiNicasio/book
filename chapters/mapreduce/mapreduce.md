# Introduction to Mapreduce {#s-mapreduce}


In this section we discuss about the background of Mapreduce along with
Hadoop and core components of Hadoop.

We start out our section with a review of the python lamda expression as well as the map function. 
Understanding these concepts is helpful for our overall understanding of map reduce.

So before you wath the video, we encourage you to oos at Sections {#s-python-lambda} and {#s-python-map}.

Now that you have a basic understanding of the map function we recommend tou watch our videos about 
mapreduce, hadoop and spark which we provide within this chapter.
