# Introduction to Mapreduce {#s-mapreduce}


In this section we discuss about the background of Mapreduce along with
Hadoop and core components of Hadoop.

We start out our section with a review of the python lambda expression as well as the map function.
Understanding these concepts is helpful for our overall understanding of map reduce.

So before you watch the video, we encourage you to learn Sections {#s-python-lambda} and {#s-python-map}.

Now that you have a basic understanding of the map function we recommend to watch our videos about
mapreduce, hadoop and spark which we provide within this chapter.
