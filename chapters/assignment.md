## Virtual Cluster

All students can contribute on the creation of the Virtual Cluster

with cloud and container farmeworks.

The residential students have been assigned this task, but online

## Projects that could substitute a chapter

manipulation of the file system

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/cm-burn>
* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/cm>

Substential contributions are expected.

## Section and Chapter Contributions

As part of the class you will be constributing a **significant**
chapter that can be used by other students in the class and introduces
the reader to a general topic, in addition it is expected if
applicable to develop a practical example demonstrating how to use a
technology. The chapter and the practical example can be the same. We
do not like to use the term tutorial in our writeup but sometimes we
refer to it in our assignments as such.

:warning: it is expected from you that you slf identify a section or a 
chapter as this shows competence in the area of cloud computing. If 
howebver you do not know what to select, you must attend an online hour 
with us in which we identify sections and chapters with you. The 
emphasize here is that we do not decite them for you, but we identify 
them with you.

Topics that could form a section or chapter that we like to integrete 
are clearly marked with a :question: . There are plenty in the handbook, 
but you are welcome to define your own contributions. Discuss them with 
us in the online hours.

A list of topics identified by students is maintained in a spreadsheet.

See <https://piazza.com/class/jgxybbf5rnx5qd?cid=201> for details.
