# How to take this class

This class is attended by a variety of students with different
backgrounds and time schedules. To be most flexible and adress all
students there are three different ways on how you can take this
class.

* Way 1: Free form. The preferred way for most students. Here you
  simply look at the Syllabus table and identify whatever section you
  feel like reading. The sections that are released are marked with
  :white_check_mark:. Note that the book may include sections that are
  not marked in the syllabus. You do not have to read such sections.

* Way 2: Linear form. The lecture notes are just like a book. We add
  sections in a logical fashion to the book once they become
  available. The section form a linear progression and you can go
  through the book in linear fashion. On weekly basis we may add a new
  section. Such sections are marked for one week with the icon :new:
  after about three weeks time all :new: icons will be removed. The
  icon is there to help you identifying sections that may have been
  added to section that logically fit better in an earlier section, than
  linearly at the end

* Way 3: Weekly guided progress. Other students may prefer
  a more guided approach to the class. Thus we will provide here a
  summary of what you can do on a weekly activity to stay up to
  date. We will add to the weekly schedule once new items become
  available. We also augment them with experiments/exercises that are not
  graded or reviewed, but that you could discuss with the
  TAs. More details ar posted in the syllabus of this class part of
  this document.


# Assignments

We have there graded assignments all other activities are geard towards
supporting these assignments. The assignments are created in such a
way that they could (but do not have to) support your class project. 
The assignments are posted in piazza in the `assignments` folder.


As setting up your computer is not really an assignment but a
precondition, we do not grade you on this. Furthermore posting the Bio
is not such a complex task and serves not only to showcase us that you
have access to Piazza and can post to it, but also allows you to let
others in the class to know them about you which may be helpful for
finding a project partner.

The real assignments for this class are as follows

Section contributions

:  You will create significan sections that could be integrated in the
   handbook, a section is about one page long in ePub format (:o: word
   count is TBD). Typically an A+ student contributes more than 5
   such sections. The sections could also include significant
   improvements. Sections can be theoretical, or programming related
   sections. The Microsoft Nafik section is a good example for e
   contributed section.

Chapter contribution

:  You will create a unique non existing chapter that can be shared
   with other students of this class. Chapters can be theoretical, but
   most often students prefer the creation of practical
   contributions. A good example is the GraphQL section

Project

:  You will create a significant non trivial project related to cloud
   computing and cloud engineering. Up to three people can
   collaborate. The project could be build on top of a previous
   project but must have significant additions or
   modifications. If a previous project is used a detailed discussion
   is to be held of what has been improved. We will discuss projects
   in one of our future lectures. There are aa lot of examples in our
   other class publications.

More details are documented throughout the course.
