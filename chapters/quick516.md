# How to take this class

This class is attended by students with greatly different backgrounds
and time schedules. To be most flexible and adress all students there
are three different ways on how you can take this class.

* Way 1: *Free form.* The preferred way for most students. Here you
  simply look at the Syllabus table for the semester and identify
  whatever section you feel like reading. The sections that are
  released are marked with :white_check_mark:. Note that the book may
  include sections that are not listed in the syllabus. You do not
  have to read such sections.

* Way 2: *Linear form.* The lecture notes are just like a book in the
  syllabus table. We add sections in a logical fashion to the book
  once they become available. The section form a linear progression
  and you can go through the book in linear fashion. On weekly basis
  we may add a new section. Such sections are marked for one week with
  the icon :new: after about three weeks time all :new: icons will be
  removed. The icon is there to help you identifying sections that may
  have been added to section that logically fit better in an earlier
  section, than linearly at the end

* Way 3: Weekly guided progress. Other students may prefer a more
  guided approach to the class. Thus we will provide a summary of what
  you can do on a weekly activity to stay up to date. We will add to
  the weekly schedule once new items become available. We also augment
  them with experiments/exercises that are not graded or reviewed, but
  that you could discuss with the TAs. More details are posted in the
  syllabus of this class part of this document.
