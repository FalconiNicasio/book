In case you see an error or like to make a contribution of your own
section or chapter, you can do so in github via pull requests.

The easiest way to fix an error is to read the ePub and click on the
cloud :cloud: symbol in a heading where you see the error. This will
bring you to an editable document. into github). You can directly fix
the error in the web browser and create there a pull request.
Naturally you need to be signed into github before you can click on
the cloud and the redirect will work.

The great thing about doing it this way is that the contributors and
authors will be integrated while we inspect with scripts the
contributor list the next time we compile the material. Thus even if
you corrected a single spelling error, you will be acknowledged.
