# Corrections

The material presented here is all managed on [github.com/cloudmesh-community/book](https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book). In case you see an error or like to make a contribution of your own section, you can do so in github via pull requests.

The easiest way to for example fix an error is to read the ePub and click on the cloud :cloud: symbol in a heading where you see the error. This will bring you to an editable document (if you are signed into github). You can directly fix the error in the web browser and create there a pull request.

The great thing about doing it this way is that the authors will be integrated from github the next time we compile the material. Thus even if you have a single spelling error corrected, you will be acknowledged.
