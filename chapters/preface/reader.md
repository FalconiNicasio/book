# ePub Readers

This document is distributed in ePub format. Every OS has a suitable
ePub reader to view the document.  Such readers can, in many cases, also
be integrated into a Web browser so that when you click on an ePub, it is
automatically opened in your browser. As we use ePubs, the document can
be scaled based on the user's preference. If you ever see content that
does not fit on a page, we recommend you zoom out to make sure you can
see the entire content.

We have made good experiences with the following readers:


* **macOSX**: [Books](https://www.apple.com/apple-books), which is a build
  in ebook reader
* **Windows 10**: [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)
* **Linux**: [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)


If you have an iPad or Tablet with enough memory, you may also be able
to use them.

Other browsers are available. Please report if you like one more than
the once specified here, so we add your suggestion.

You may want to adjust the zoom of your reader to increase or
decrease it. Please adjust your zoom to a level that is comfortable for
you. On macOS with a larger monitor, we found that zooming out multiple
times results in very good rendering allowing you to see the source code
without horizontal scrolling.
