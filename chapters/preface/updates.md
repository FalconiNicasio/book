# Updates

As all documents are managed in GitHub, the list of updates is
documented in the commit history at

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/commits/master>

In case you do a lecture with us, we recommend that you download a new
version of the ePub every week. This way, you are typically staying up
to date. You can check the commit history and identify if the version of
the ePub is older than the committed version. If so, we recommend that
you download a new version.

> ![Warning](images/warning.png) *We typically will not make announcements to the class as the
>          GitHub commit history is sufficient, and you are responsible
>          to monitor it as part of your class activities.*
