# How to take this class

This class is an undergraduate class that containes two sections 
that you must attend. 

First it contains a lecture section that will introduce you 
theoretiv=cally to some concepts that are important for this class. 
Online lectures may augment these lectures that you also will have to 
look at. In addition you you certainly look up material relevant to the 
lecture in books or online resources, as well as these lecture notes.

To allow you to be most flixible in taking this class, we certainly 
allow you to work ahead. This you can use all but the in person lectures 
ahead of time. The Syllabus will clearly identify which material is available.
Note that the book may include sections that are
not marked in the syllabus. You do not have to read such sections.

Please note that this class does not have *small* assignments and any 
assignment is likeley to take you some time. Thus it is advisabe that 
you start your assignments early and make sure you do not do them in 
the last week. In order to facilitate this we will introduce graded 
checkpoints of all large assignments. The grades for these checkoiints 
are final and can not be impproved by work done later.

To further make sure you progress, you will have to manage a notebook.md 
file in your github directory (that we will create for you) in which you will 
update your weekly progress. If you miss a lecture, it is in your responsibility to 
inform yourself what was being taught. Attendence and participation will be graded.

In the following calendar we put in the last day of the week 
when the assignments are typically due
