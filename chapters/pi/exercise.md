## Exercise

### Single Raspberry Pi


## Single Pi :o:

TODO: improve the link

You have been presented in Section
[Cluster Case With Cooling (5 Pi)](#temp-cluster)
with a table that
compares tempreatures. Your task is to identify issues with the
experiment and the table. Furthermore we like you to rerun a
temperature experiment in the entire class.

1. Get a PI3 modeL B, an HDMI cable, a power supply, a case. Such a
 configuration is listed in the IoT section.

2. Buy or manufacture a case of your choice. You can use a 3d-printer
 if you have one available.

3. Conduct a temperature experiment.

Discussion of these assignment is to be executed openly in class. Points
will be issued only once the class agrees upon an experiment.

This exercise is not only to learn about the behaviour of the Pi, but
also about how to coordinate experiments with a large number of
students.

### Exercise

Pi.Single.1

: What temperature measurement is missing from the table.

Pi.Single.2

: How would you create an experiment under *load*.

Pi.Single.3

: How would you create an experiment to which all students in
  different classes could contribute their values? Can the cloud be
  used?

Pi.Single.4

: Collect the information from all class members using cloud services.

Pi.Single.5

: Identify how to use the VPN server so you can use your Laptop
instead of a TV or computer monitor. Write a tutorial.
