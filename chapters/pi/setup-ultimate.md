# Raspberry PI Setup

This section will be a the start for the replacement for all previous setup instructions. 
I think we want ultimately the section "PI Network of Workstations" to also use this 
or be the final section.

Once the content has either been integrated here or it is determinde that 
the previous file is no longer needed, we will move the other file into a dir 
deprecated, and remove the file from chapter.yaml.

We will aslo need to manage a second documentation just for CM-burn in 
the cm-burn repo that jsut focusses on cm-burn as this is also a stand alone prg

The duplicated setions we are aware of include:

If its integrated is 

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/cm-burn/blob/master/README.md>
* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/setup.md>
* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/initial-setup.md>
* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/pi-passwordreset.md>
* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/run-at-boot.md>
* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/sd-card.md>
* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/clusters/pi-configure-cluster.md>
* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/clusters/pi-setup.md>
 

I also see that portions of other files include or can leverage what we do in cm-burn and thsu we can 
replace that info or morege portions of it such as in and than these sections need to be fixed while using 
our ultimate guide, e.g. make a pointer to it

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/kubernetes/pi-kubernetes.md>
* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/kubernetes/526/readme-kube.md>
* <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/kubernetes/417/pi-kubernetes.md>
 

As you see everyone duplicated in part the steps. So what we need is a single section that describes 
the cm-burn procedure, but also the steps needed by hand for those that can not afford the $50 
investment of the mount prg.
