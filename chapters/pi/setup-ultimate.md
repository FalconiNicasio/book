# Raspberry PI Setup

This section will be a the start for the replacement for all previous setup instructions. 
I think we want ultimately the section "PI Network of Workstations" to also use this 
or be the final section.

Once the content has either been integrated here or it is determinde that 
the previous file is no longer needed, we will move the other file into a dir 
deprecated, and remove the file from chapter.yaml.

We will aslo need to manage a second documentation just for CM-burn in 
the cm-burn repo that jsut focusses on cm-burn as this is also a stand alone prg

The duplicated setions we are aware of include:

If its integrated mark the checkmark. We need to be carful not to lose info

* [ ] <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/cm-burn/blob/master/README.md>
* [ ] <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/setup.md>
* [ ] <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/initial-setup.md>
* [ ] <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/pi-passwordreset.md>
* [ ] <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/run-at-boot.md>
* [ ] <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/sd-card.md>
* [ ] <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/clusters/pi-configure-cluster.md>
* [ ] <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/clusters/pi-setup.md>
 
There may even be more such documentation as part of student projects. No student that does a PI project MUST DESCRIBE HOW THEY SET UP THE CLUSTER IN THEIR REPORT. THEY ALL MUST IMPROVE OR USE THIS SECTION.

I also see that portions of other files include or can leverage what we do in cm-burn and thsu we can 
replace that info or morege portions of it such as in and than these sections need to be fixed while using 
our ultimate guide, e.g. make a pointer to it

* [ ] <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/kubernetes/pi-kubernetes.md>
* [ ] <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/kubernetes/526/readme-kube.md>
* [ ] <https://github.com/cloudmesh-community/book/blob/master/chapters/pi/kubernetes/417/pi-kubernetes.md>
 

As you see everyone duplicated in part the steps. So what we need is a single section that describes 
the cm-burn procedure, but also the steps needed by hand for those that can not afford the $50 
investment of the mount prg. 

Next we propose an outline. Help improving the outline than contribute here to this single document 
while not replicationg sections but refer to sections if needed. IF difference between windows osx and linux, aslo include the differences.

## Setting up a Single Raspberry PI

Discuss here the steps to do that including burning the sd card. IT is fine to use etcher, BUt there is one solution discussed that does dd which we aslo like to keep

## Setting up a Small Cluster by Hand

THis explains how to set up a small cluster by hand discussing how to burn multiple cards. It uses the method of booting the pi and using a monitor to set up each of them. starting with passwd

## Setting up Many Pis for a Cluster

THis discusses how to set things up for many PIs with cm burn, we have multiple scenarios

### Setting up a small cluster with cm-burn

here we discuss teh 5 node setup

### Setting up a large cluster with cm-burn

here we discuss one lareg cluster setup lets say 100 nodes

#### Static network addresses

#### DHCP setup

#### PXE Boot

### Setting up a plugable cluster of clusters with cm-burn

Here we discuss a class of students that each ahve 5 node clusters 
that come in a room to place their clusters in a shelf then they plug it into a 
power strip and a network, they replace the sd card of the master with a worker sd card
there is a special master that detects new workers and inventories them with different 
states, so we can get to them if they are registered.
