## Setting up a Cluster of Clusters with cm-burn

Here we discuss a class of students that each have 5 node clusters
that come in a room to place their clusters in a shelf then they plug
it into a power strip and a network, they replace the SD card of the
master with a worker SD card there is a special master that detects
new workers and inventories them with different states, so we can get
to them if they are registered.
